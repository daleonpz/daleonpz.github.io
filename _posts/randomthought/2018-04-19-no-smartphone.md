My smartphone died yesterday morning and that day I had to do many things that requires a hard use of my smartphone such as know public transport schedule, go to an event (know where I am, check maps, scan QR codes, take pictures), and read in class.

Anyway, I managed to do everything without my phone and turned out to be not that complicated. So I noticed two things: 
- I don't rely to much on my smartphone
- I don't understand why people use so much the smartphone, maybe if I google it I will find something, but I will not do it.
