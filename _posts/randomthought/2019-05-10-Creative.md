Has you ever been criticized?

Last Friday I was in a intercultural event in Dortmund.
And there was a workshop about "Christmas decorations".
So I took part in it.


The basic idea was to create something with the material they had there.
I decided to be creative and try to explore my options. 


But my friends were making fun of my work.
Because they thought it looked weird.
But I said to them  "I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm trying to see what happens".
There is nothing wrong with that. 

That day I learned two things:

- There will be always people who won't understand you. 
- "Creativity comes from the freedom to fail" (Peter Gabriel)
