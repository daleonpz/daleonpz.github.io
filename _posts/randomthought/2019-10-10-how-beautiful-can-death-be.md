My flat is in front of  the Dortmund Harbor. 
From there I can see big leafy trees and the canal that goes through the north part of the city.

Today I was looking the sunset through my window. 
It's October in Germany and I had this amazing view of the orange sky and falling leafs over the water. 


**<center>... I started thinking about death. </center>**

Sunsets and falling leafs are  constant death reminders.
But aren't  these two events incredibly beautiful to look at? 

So, why not see death in the same way?

> Call for the grandest of all earthly spectacles, what is that? It is the sun going to his rest. ― Thomas de Quincey 

Maybe the _SUNSET_ of our life is unbelievable and beautiful experience. 
But we may miss it.
Because we can't take breaks to look at our life. 


**<center> Enjoy and contemplate YOUR SUNSET  </center>**

When your time comes...
