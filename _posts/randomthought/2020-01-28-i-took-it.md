![I took it - Oportunity - comic](/images/posts/awmstrips/i-took-it.jpg)

For most of my life, I was selfish as hell. 
I didn't even hesitate using others for my benefit.
And the worst thing was that I didn't even give something in return...

Not even a **Thank you**.

Maybe that was the main reason I lost some friends.

However, in 2013 I started to travel the world. USA, Thailand, Singapore, Europe, Morocco and so on, and  also to **notice something**...

I do parkour for a long time. And  parkour community, I would say, is supportive. Back then  it was even more.

To every city I went to. I was looking always someone to train with. But at the same time, I was looking for someone to host me.
Many people did it.
 Some of them for one night, and others for even a whole week.
They did enjoy opening their homes to almost a stranger and giving him a place to sleep. 

**<center> It was an  eye-opener experience.</center>**


In exchange for their kindness. I sometimes cleaned their homes, cooked for them, or even listened to them when they needed someone to talk to.

You know... **I felt great**. Doing things for others and expecting nothing in return.

That's when my selfish behavior changed... 

Don't get me wrong. I'm still selfish. But now I give value to people's life. And I enjoy doing it. 

Life gives you opportunities to improve or change your life. The best part is that you don't even have to ask for them. 

Your job is only to be aware of them and take them. 

If you ask me... How would have been my life, if I haven't taken that opportunity to change my selfish behavior...

I have no idea.

And I don't care either.
