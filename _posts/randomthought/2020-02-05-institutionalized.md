_Shawshank Redemption_ is my favourite film. I watched at least 10 times in the last 5 years. 
And that phrase is carved on my brain.

Institutionalized, for me, means to **not living on your own terms** and be afraid to do something about it.
Because you feel "safe" in your current situation, even if you hate it or complain all the time about it.

Remember...

**<center> You always have a CHOICE.</center>**

Look at your current life and ask yourself... 

Do I really want this? Do I really want to be in the same situation in 5, 10 or  20 years?
