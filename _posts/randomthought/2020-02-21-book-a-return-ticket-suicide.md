I think every person has thought at least one time about committing suicide. 
Reasons and opinions differ from person to person.

**<center>But I want to share my case...</center>**

As a kid and teenager, I had suicidal thoughts. I never really tried to commit suicide. But the thoughts were there.

Back then, I looked at suicide as a way to stop my emotional pain. And I wanted to commit suicide at that moment... When I was feeling pain. 

However, 

**<center>Now it's DIFFERENT.</center>**

I still want to commit suicide. But not because I'm suffering. 
**I enjoy my life**. 

I smile every day. I love myself. I'm healthy. I'm always learning. My heart is in peace. 

So,

**<center>Why do I want to commit suicide then?</center>**

The short answer is...**Freedom**.

I want to have the freedom to choose for how long I want to live. **I want to choose my upper limit**.
That's all...nothing deeper than that.

But, what if I die before my _due date_?

I don't care. I'm okay with that. I know I cannot control everything.

For me, **the quality of my life is much more important** than its duration.
