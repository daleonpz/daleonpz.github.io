I'm at a point where I have to decide between taking a path that might offer more chances to change my career, but comes with a cost in terms of time, money, and stress, or going with a path that interests me more, but has similar costs. Right now, I'm leaning towards the second option because I think the first one might help me tweak my career a bit, but in the long run, I'm more drawn to path B.

Sure, what I can learn on path A is valuable, no doubt, but the information is out there for everyone. And the same experience... well, maybe it's unique, but I don't think it's a game changer.

Thinking about it, path B has always called to me. In brief moments of my life, I've walked down that path and enjoyed it a lot. That's why I feel it might be time to fully embrace it.
