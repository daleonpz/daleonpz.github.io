I listened a [podcast](https://www.successpodcast.com/show-notes/2016/12/28/why-you-shouldnt-follow-your-passion-the-rare-value-of-deep-work-with-cal-newport) today about how to find a job you like. The following quote stayed with me:

---
There’s a **big difference** between what makes you enjoy an activity that you do in your leisure time and what makes people enjoy a profession. 

What makes you **enjoy an activity** in your leisure time is its’ own sort of thing, but we have a lot of research on what leads people to find motivation, passion or satisfaction in professional endeavors and it has nothing to do with matching that activity to preexisting interest.

The **things we know matter in the professional world** is for example:  
    - **A sense of autonomy**. You control what you do, how you do it, when you do it.  
    - **A sense of mastery** is also important. You’re good at what you do, you have a craft that you’re respected for.  
    - **A sense of impact on the world** is very important.  
    - **A sense of connection to other people on things that matter**.  

These types of traits are what consistently lead people to say, “I’m passionate about what I’ll do,” and you’ll notice that none of those traits have anything to do with you match the job to some sort of preexisting, intrinsic trait you had before you chose the job.

Again, this idea that we’re wired to do something and if you get a job that matches it, you’ll really like that job.
