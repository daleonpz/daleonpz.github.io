I've been thinking about how to secure retirement. When it comes to securing your retirement, it's essential to save money. The more you can save, the better. So, how can I save more money? On way is to spend less, but a less restrictive way is to earn more and keep my expenses relatively "stable". I chose the second option.

Well, the idea is pretty basic. The more valuable I'm, the more potential I have to earn more money. This brings me to a key concept that's guiding my career...

```
              V A L U E = NOPAT(t) x [1 - g/ROIC] / (WACC - g)

(つ▀¯▀ )つ    
```

Let me break down nitty-gritty of the basic valuation math:

- NOPAT: This stands for net operating profits after taxes, essentially the money I make for the company.
- Growth: This is all about increasing my salary.
- Invested Capital: Think of this as my salary.
- ROIC (Return on Investment Capital): ROIC is calculated as NOPAT(t) divided by Invested Capital(t).
- Cost of Capital (WACC): This indicates how much risk I pose to the company.

To apply this to my own life, I had to make a few adjustments:

```
Value = NOPAT(t) x [1 - g/ROIC] / (WACC - g)
Value = MoneyForCompany x [1 - increaseMySalary / ROIC] / RiskForTheCompany
```

Let's break it down further:

```
increaseMySalary = ROIC x (1 - RiskForTheCompany)
```

At the end I ended up to logical conclusions:

- Being loyal is a big plus for the company.
- The less they have to invest in you, the better.
- If they do invest in you, you need to help them make as much money as possible.
- I'll earn more if I contribute to the company's profits or make them save money.

I was an overkill what I did but it was still fun to prove it.
