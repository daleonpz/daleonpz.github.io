I like building things, and to be creative, I need to optimize my workflow.

I enjoy when I'm in the flow, that's when I'm at my most creative. But reaching that state usually requires some prep. I need to take my time to think, analyze, and fully understand what’s in front of me. Part of that process involves running "discovery tests" to gain a some degree of understanding of the problem. Once I’ve reached that point, I execute at lightning speed.

Now, back to creativity and optimization: How much optimization do I need in my workflow to stay creative?

Well... I rely on my instincts for this. My rule of thumb is simple: if something feels like it's disturbing my execution, it's time to optimize. It’s like running on a treadmill that’s not quite set to the right speed—something needs adjusting.

That said, it’s essential to find balance. Optimization is a tool to serve creativity, not the goal in and of itself.

To sum up how I work: take time to understand, execute speed, and optimize when necessary.
