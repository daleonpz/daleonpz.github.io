# On my freetime currently working on
I'm a problem solver, whenever I see/encounter problem I learn as much as possible about it to understand and i don't stop until I find a solution that works the way I want / satisfy / optimal. 

I thrive specially when there is a "swim or sink" situation. I'm confident that I somehow can make it work. 

I'm resourfulness. Selling pants.. ice cream, uni buying supplies, selling chapanas..  

By travelling, use carisma

libian story... 

parkour group... 



money ---> para no tener que lidiar con nada
un lugar donde pueda ser yo..

Dilemma... busco solo no estar no feliz, es donde mas tranquilo estoy pero no se si eso es estar feliz. No se realmente si soy feliz, sera la felicidad la ausencia de infelicidada? 

etiquetas.... cuando no se entiende al otro, lo mas facil es etiquetar? para tener un framework desde donde analizar.. tu ers A y debes comportarte como A.ttt

# About me
I like to figure out how technology can be used to make life better. That's the reason I'm constantly learning from different and unrelated fields, developing theories,  thinking, and debating ideas. However, I also see data and numbers as the best, and sometimes the only way, to figure out business solutions. 

In my free time, when I'm not jumping around doing parkour, I'm learning about business analysis and strategy and developing machine learning applications.

- I learned about management, accounting, finance, negotiation, marketing, and sales.

`2020`

# On my freetime currently working on
- I'm assiting a start-up with their AI application in pytorch, I'm also learning the framework during the process. 
- I'm learning about business management and entrepeneurship using as reference the ["Core Curriculum"](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/core-curriculum/), Business Cases of Harvard Business Publishing and ["Harvard ManageMentor"](https://hbr.org/harvardmanagementor). Among the skills that I am learning and deepening are the following: Finances, Accounting, Strategy Thinking and Planning, Negotiation and Team management.
- Still improving my german. Currently between B2-C1. Ich spreche bei der Arbeit and mit meiner Freunde Deutsch, d.H das gilt in 95% der Zeit. Daher würde ich sagen, dass mein Deutsch fachlich kompetent ist.

# Experience leading teams
`2020`: Al fondo a la derecha podcast. I started and lead this proyect for 1 year with some friends from USA and Peru. We talk about practical tips based on finances, social psychology and marketing. We stopped the project because we realized that we were not having fun. I learned how to work with a global team, set tasks to run independently and delegate responsabilities.

`2015-2017`: InnerMovement Parkour Group. I started this project with a friend of mine but we ended up being 4. I was in charge of our marketing campaing with included but not limited to video and photo shooting, and social media management. And also business development, the main strategy was creating a solid and loyal community through workshops and guided trainings, and leveraging that to promote our paid events  and sell our clothing collection. I learned a lot about finances, budgeting, supply chain and product development, sales and marketing.
