# On my freetime currently working on
I'm a problem solver, whenever I see/encounter problem I learn as much as possible about it to understand and i don't stop until I find a solution that works the way I want / satisfy / optimal. 

I thrive specially when there is a "swim or sink" situation. I'm confident that I somehow can make it work. 

I'm resourfulness. Selling pants.. ice cream, uni buying supplies, selling chapanas..  

By travelling, use carisma

libian story... 

parkour group... 



money ---> para no tener que lidiar con nada
un lugar donde pueda ser yo..

Dilemma... busco solo no estar no feliz, es donde mas tranquilo estoy pero no se si eso es estar feliz. No se realmente si soy feliz, sera la felicidad la ausencia de infelicidada? 

etiquetas.... cuando no se entiende al otro, lo mas facil es etiquetar? para tener un framework desde donde analizar.. tu ers A y debes comportarte como A.ttt

MY Elevator pitch.. may include what I'm good (main interests and skills) at where i'm going  and what I'm looknig for (valuen).

Looking for the next challenge, some interesting problem I would like to solve and sale.

tengo una corazonada hacia mas o menos donde me gustaria ir hoy, y luego dejo que el camino me sorprenda. Por eso estoy abierto a probar cosas, al final uno nunca con que se puede encontrar. 


- que me gustaria erfahren en el trabajo
tiene que ser algo visual.. artistico, bello 
algo que me permita explorar opciones, setear rutas/ caminos (business, strategy)
solucionar un problema que yo tenga y q sea interesante

# On my freetime currently working on
TinyML applications for STM32F746G and ESP32-EYE. Exploring tensorflow lite/micro, Cube-AI from ST Microelectronics and low-power video/audio/autoencoders applications. 

why not combine my two areas of expertise :)

# Employment
`2020-` 
__Qbeyond AG__ Senior Software Engineer  
__Tools__: Git, CI/CD, Docker, Embeded Linux, Python, C, Test-Driven Development, Bulding systems (CMake, Make, Rake), Ruby, Python, Bash.  
**Tasks:**  
- Development of features for home automation devices. Linux based gateways with wifi (through MQTT) and radio (823 MHz) connectivity and end-point devices based on STM32 M0 with radio (823 MHz) connectivity. In charge also of the maintenance of radio protocol repository. Development with Keil and Gitlab-CI.
- Development of a debugging tool for a Propetary Android Device based on a Rockchip processor with disable Android Debug Bridge. Used Binary Walk and Bash to read the raw flash memory; search, extract and mount the Linux F2FS filesystem; extract relevant databases and csv files, and show them in the terminal.  
- Development of a POC (proof of concept) with the MSP430 microcontroller from TI, a LPWA module from Quectel and 2G in C. Developed a interface between a pump (UART) and Cloud (MQTT).
- Development of small test gateway based on a DA1468X Dialog MCU for communication between devices based on DA1468X and Cloud (REST). The development involved Python and C.
- Worked in the development of a industrial gateway using Python based Embedded Linux and the Teamviewer API. 
- In charge of writing the code guidelines for C, dockerizing the toolchain for MPS430 and Dialog MCUs, and dockerizing Ceedling (a C test framework). 
- In charge of automating the code quality assurance using Docker. Check that the code follows our code guidelines. Control of the code complexity. Inspection of the code using static analysis tools. The development was mainly in Bash, Docker and Gitlab CI/CD.
- Development of tests for a industrial gateway that uses the BACnet Protocol. The development was in Javascript and Bash. 
- Development of the Build system for industrial gateways using Gitlab CI/CD.
- Working on the development of industrial gateways for the Automation Industry. The technologies involved in this project Websockets, Bacnet Protocol and MQTT. The  gateways code is in C, but runs on embedded linux.

# Projects 
`2017 (April - August)`
[XXL clothing](https://www.facebook.com/prendasxxl).  Small fashion business for Urban sports I had with a friend of mine. I was really fun, we started with 33 USD as initial investment and we made 2400 USD in net profit in 3 months, before we stopped with it. I had to move to Germany.
