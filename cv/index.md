# On my freetime
- I’m developing TinyML applications for STM32F746G and ESP32-EYE using tensorﬂow lite/micro and Cube-AI from ST Microelectronics for low-power video/audio/autoencoders applications.
- I’m assiting part-time a start-up with their AI application in pytorch while also learning the framework.
- I'm learning about business management and entrepreneurship using as reference the ["Core Curriculum"](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/core-curriculum/), Business Cases of Harvard Business Publishing and ["Harvard ManageMentor"](https://hbr.org/harvardmanagementor).

# Employment
`2020-` 
__Qbeyond AG__ Senior Software Engineer  
__Tools__: Git, CI/CD, Docker, Embedded Linux, Python, C, Test-Driven Development, Building systems (CMake, Make, Rake), Ruby, Python, Bash.  
**Tasks:**  
- Development of features for home automation devices. Linux based gateways with Wi-Fi (through MQTT) and radio (823 MHz) connectivity and end-point devices based on STM32 M0 with radio (823 MHz) connectivity. Also in charge of the maintenance of radio protocol repository. Development with Keil and Gitlab-CI.
- Development of a debugging tool for a Proprietary Android Device based on a Rockchip processor with disable Android Debug Bridge. Used Binary Walk and Bash to read the raw flash memory; search, extract and mount the Linux F2FS file system; extract relevant databases and csv files, and show them in the terminal.  
- Development of a POC (proof of concept) with the MSP430 microcontroller from TI, a LPWA module from Quectel and 2G in C. Developed a interface between a pump (UART) and Cloud (MQTT).
- Development of small test gateway based on a DA1468X Dialog MCU for communication between devices based on DA1468X and Cloud (REST). The development involved Python and C.
- Worked in the development of a industrial gateway using Python based Embedded Linux and the Teamviewer API. 
- In charge of writing the code guidelines for C, dockerizing the toolchain for MPS430 and Dialog MCUs, and dockerizing Ceedling (a C test framework). 
- In charge of automating the code quality assurance using Docker. Check that the code follows our code guidelines. Control of the code complexity. Inspection of the code using static analysis tools. The development was mainly in Bash, Docker and Gitlab CI/CD.
- Development of tests for a industrial gateway that uses the BACnet Protocol. The development was in Javascript and Bash. 
- Development of the Build system for industrial gateways using Gitlab CI/CD.
- Working on the development of industrial gateways for the Automation Industry. The technologies involved in this project Websockets, Bacnet Protocol and MQTT. The  gateways code is in C, but runs on embedded linux.

# Projects 
`2017 (April - August)`
[XXL clothing](https://www.facebook.com/prendasxxl). Small urban sports fashion business I had with a friend of mine. It was a lot of fun, we started with 33 USD as initial investment and made 2400 USD net profit in 3 months, before I quit, because I had to move to Germany.

`2017-`
