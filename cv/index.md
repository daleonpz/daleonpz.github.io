# About me
I like to figure out how technology can be used to make life better. That's the reason I'm constantly learning from different and unrelated fields, developing theories,  thinking, and debating ideas. However, I also see data and numbers as the best, and sometimes the only way, to figure out business solutions. 

In my free time, when I'm not jumping around doing parkour, I'm learning about business analysis and strategy and developing machine learning applications.

# Projects 
`2016-2017`
[XXL clothing](https://www.facebook.com/prendasxxl). 
- Small urban sports fashion business I had with a friend of mine. I quit because I had to move to Germany. It was a lot of fun, we started with almost no capital and I earned enough to pay for my plane ticket to Germany and cover my expenses for a few months. 
- I learned about management, accounting, finance, negotiation, marketing, and sales.

`2020`
