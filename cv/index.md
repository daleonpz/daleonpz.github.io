# About me
I like to figure out how technology can be used to make life better. That's the reason I'm constantly learning from different and unrelated fields, developing theories,  thinking, and debating ideas. However, I also see data and numbers as the best, and sometimes the only way, to figure out business solutions. 

In my free time, when I'm not jumping around doing parkour, I'm learning about business analysis and strategy and developing machine learning applications.

# Experience leading teams
`2020`: Al fondo a la derecha podcast. I started and lead this project for 1 year with some friends from USA and Peru. We talked about practical tips based on finances, social psychology, and marketing. We stopped the project because we realized that we were not having fun. I learned how to work with a global team, set tasks to run independently, and delegate responsibilities.

`2015-2017`: InnerMovement Parkour Group. I started this project with a friend of mine but we ended up being 4. I was in charge of our marketing campaign including video and photo shooting, and social media management. And also business development, the main strategy was creating a solid and loyal community through workshops and guided training, and leveraging that to promote our paid events and sell our clothing collection. I learned a lot about finances, budgeting, supply chain and product development, sales, and marketing.

# Employment
`2020-` 
__Qbeyond AG (Cologne, DE)__ Senior Software Engineer  
__Tools__: Git, CI/CD, Docker, Embedded Linux, Python, C, Test-Driven Development, Building systems (CMake, Make, Rake), Ruby, Python, Bash.  
**Tasks:**  
- Development of features for home automation devices. Linux-based gateways with Wi-Fi (through MQTT) and radio (823 MHz) connectivity and end-point devices based on STM32 M0 with radio (823 MHz) connectivity. Also in charge of the maintenance of the radio protocol repository. Development with Keil and Gitlab-CI.
- Development of a debugging tool for a Proprietary Android Device based on a Rockchip processor with a disabled Android Debug Bridge. Used Binary Walk and Bash to read the raw flash memory; search, extract and mount the Linux F2FS file system; extract relevant databases and CSV files, and show them in the terminal.  
- Development of a POC (proof of concept) with the MSP430 microcontroller from TI, an LPWA module from Quectel and 2G in C. Developed an interface between a pump (UART) and Cloud (MQTT).
- Development of a small test gateway based on a DA1468X Dialog MCU for communication between devices based on DA1468X and Cloud (REST). The development involved Python and C.
- Worked in the development of an industrial gateway using Python, Embedded Linux, and the Teamviewer API. 
- In charge of writing the code guidelines for C, dockerizing the toolchain for MPS430 and Dialog MCUs, and dockerizing Ceedling (a C test framework). 
- In charge of automating the code quality assurance using Docker. Check that the code follows our code guidelines. Control of the code complexity. Inspection of the code using static analysis tools. The development was mainly in Bash, Docker, and Gitlab CI/CD.
- Development of tests for an industrial gateway that uses the BACnet Protocol. The development was in Javascript and Bash. 
- Development of the Build system for industrial gateways using Gitlab CI/CD.
- Working on the development of industrial gateways for the Automation Industry. The technologies involved in this project were Websockets, Bacnet Protocol, and MQTT. The  gateway's code is in C but runs on embedded Linux.
